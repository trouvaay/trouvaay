      <strong>THE CONCEPT OF RARE DOOR</strong> evolved out of our own frustrations with furnishing our homes. Our mission is to make it easier for people to find furniture that is aligned with their tastes and available locally. We curate furniture from independent retailers across the Bay Area, enabling you to find that special piece without wandering from store to store, sifting through inventory. Oh, and once you’ve found that piece, you don’t have to be concerned about getting it home.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>SO WHY THE NAME ‘RARE DOOR'?</strong> Door is derived from d’or, which is French for gold. Let us introduce you to rare gold.

Our mission is to make it easier for people to find furniture that is aligned with their tastes and available locally.

	    <h4>
	      More treasure, less hunting.
	    </h4>
	  </div>
	  <div class="tab-pane text-editor" id="shipping">
	    <p>
	    We know the disappointment that comes with finding a great piece of furniture and then realizing that shipping cost more than the item itself. Even worse, sometimes you have to coordinate the delivery on your own. We want to remove all that hassle. 
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    We charge $5 for small items, $65 for bulk items (not included in your item's list price)..
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    After you’ve placed your order, we’ll call you and coordinate a delivery time that is convenient for you.
	    </p>
	  </div>
	  <div class="tab-pane text-editor" id="returns">
	    <p>
	    Our return policy varies based on each individual item and is listed at the bottom of each detailed product page.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    Because we're locally focused, we give you the opportunity to experience the product before you pay for it.  You have 48 hours to go touch, feel, and see your item in-store & then confirm your purchase.If we don't hear from you in 48 hours, the transaction is cancelled. </br></br>The convenience of online shopping without the regret.</h4>
